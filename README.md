# __Getting Started__
Below is the complete demonstration on how the game works. Try it out and enjoy Alien Vs Zombie game to the fullest extent!

### __1. Game Settings__
![Game Settings](screenshots/game-settings.png)
   <br />The program would start of with a default game settings containing 3 rows, 5 columns and 1 zombie. User will be prompted if they wish to change the settings, user will have to type "y" or "n". If they type "n", they will be redirect to the gameboard with the default settings, while if they type "y", they will be asked to enter the rows, columns and number of zombies they wish to display. The user could only enter odd number values for the board dimensions. In the case where they enter even number values, they will be prompted to re-enter again.

<br />

### __2. Game Dashboard__
![Game Dashboard](screenshots/game-dashboard.png)
   <br />Next, it will shows a game dashboard which is created according to the rows and columns specified by the user. Below the gameboard, we have the game characters display which is the alien, as well as the zombies. The arrow on the left of the alien is used to indicate which characters turn is active. The gameboard is randomly generated with objects in which it contains: Health(h), Pod(p), Rock(r), Arrow(^/V/>/<) (For more information, Refer to [Section 1.3](#13-game-objects) on how the object functions) 

<br />

### __3. Alien Movement & Health Object__
![Alien Movement](screenshots/alien-move.png)
   <br />As you can see from the above demonstration, the arrow on the left of the alien indicate that its the alien turn, user can either type "left", "right", "up" or "down" to move the Alien. In this condition, user type in "left" to move the alien to the left. 
   
![Health Object](screenshots/health-object.png)
   <br />The alien encounters a health pack. The health pack will add 20 life to the alien. If the alien already reaches its maximum health, there is no increment in the health anymore. In this case, the alien's health will not be increasing as the alien's health is already reaches its full capacity. 
   </br>

![Alien Trail](screenshots/alien-trail.png)
   <br/>Now let's continue to move. As the alien moves, it will leave a trail behind him (represented by a "."), this indicates that the alien has travelled that path before. Alien finds an empty space and it continues to move.
   
<br/>

### __4. Pod Object__
![Pod Object](screenshots/pod-object.png)
   <br/>This time alien encounters a pod object. The pod would attack the nearest zombie which in this case is zombie 1. Zombie 1 receives a damage of 10 and its life is now decrement to 102. However zombie 1 survives. Therefore, the alien would continue to move.
   
<br/>

### __5. Arrow Object__
![Arrow Object](screenshots/arrow-object.png)
   <br/>Now the alien encounters a "v" arrow which indicate moving downwards, the arrow could add 20 attack points to the alien. In this situation, the alien could make use of the arrow object to attack zombie 1 which is located right below the arrow. 

![Alien Attack](screenshots/alien-attack-1.png)
   <br/>It's time to attack zombie 1!! As you can see, zombie 1 receives a damage of 20 and its life is decreased to 82. However zombie 1 is still alive.

![Zombie Turns](screenshots/zombie1-turns.png)
   <br/>As mentioned earlier in [Section 1.2](#12-movement-and-attack), the alien would stop when the zombie survives the attack from the alien. Alien's turn would end and it's now switch to Zombie 1's turn.

<br/>

### __6. Zombie 1's Movement and Attack__
![Zombie Turns](screenshots/zombie1-turns2.png)
   <br/>Now its Zombie 1's turn. Zombie 1 moves 1 step to the left. As you can notice here, the alien's trail, represented by a ".", is now reinitialised to new game objects.

![Zombie Attack](screenshots/zombie-attack1.png)
   <br/>Alien is in danger! As alien is within the range of zombie 1 which in this case is 5, zombie 1 could attack the alien. Alien receives a damage of 11 and it is still alive. 
   
<br/>

### __7. Zombie 2's Movement__
![Zombie Turns](screenshots/zombie2-turns.png)
   <br/>As you can see, alien's life is now decreased to 130 and it's turn is switch to zombie 2. Zombie 2 chooses to moves right.

![Zombie Attack](screenshots/zombie-attack2.png)
   <br/>In this case zombie 2 could only attack the alien if its within the range of 8. Since the alien is too far from the zombie's range, zombie 2 is unable to attack alien. Therefore Zombie 2's turn ends and will move on to the alien again.
   
<br/>

### __8. Rock Object__
![Rock Object](screenshots/rock-object.png)
   <br/>Let's discover what will happen when the alien stumbles upon a rock. In this situation, Alien moves up and encounters a rock. As previously mention in [section 1.3](#13-game-objects), the rock reveals a hidden game object when hit by alien. It discovers nothing beneath the rock. The alien would stop and its turn ends. 

<br/>

### __9. Arrow Commands__
![Arrow Command 1](screenshots/arrow-command-1.png)
    <br/>Introducing the arrow commands! Now let's say you want to move the alien to go down, you could use the arrow command which will prompt the user to type in the arrow rows, columns and the directions they wish to change for. For this situation, we wanted to change the arrow direction for row 2 column 3 to down, we could type "2 3 down" to change the arrow direction. Tada! The arrow is now changed to down and alien could move to the targeted zombie again. 
   
![Zombie 1 defeated](screenshots/zombie-defeated-1.png)
    <br/>As you can see, alien accumulated an attack of 40 which is enough to kill zombie 1. Now it's time to kill zombie 1!

![Arrow Command 2](screenshots/arrow-command-2.png)
    <br/>As you can see, zombie 1 is defeated and its life became 0, it is now removed from the gameboard. Now let's target to kill zombie 2! In order to get to zombie 2, we will have to change the arrow direction at row 1 column 16 to the left. 
   
![Zombie 2 defeated](screenshots/zombie-defeated-2.png)
    <br/>Now all the directions have been change to direct to zombie 2 and off we go to kill the zombies!! As you can see, alien accumulate an attack of 40 and is enough to kill zombie 2. Zombie 2 is now defeated with its life becoming 0.

<br />

### __10. Winner__
![Winner](screenshots/winner.png)
   <br/>Now all the zombies have been defeated, alien wins!!!  
   
<br />

### __11. Play Again__
![Play Again](screenshots/play-again.png)
   <br/>Notice that there is a prompt to ask the user if they want to play again or not. If the user type in "n", the game would automatically quit. In this case the user wanted to play again, the user would have to type "y", the game would show another different gameboard with the same attributes values as the previous game for alien and zombies.

<br />

### __12. Save Game__
![Save Game](screenshots/save-game.png)
   <br/>In the case when the user wanted to save the game and play next time, they could type "save" and the program would prompt the user to enter a file name to save the current game. The file name that the user enter must be in a text based file format. Let's type "game1.txt" to save the game. Now the game is saved to your computer. So what to do if next time we wanted to play the game that we saved?

<br />

### __13. Load Game__
![Load Game](screenshots/load-game.png)
   <br/>To open the game that we have saved, we could type "load" in the command and the program would ask the user if they want to save the current game. Let's say the user enter "n" for no,  the program would ask the user to enter the file name to load, let's enter the file name, "game1.txt" that we have saved just now, notice that the program automatically updates the gameboard that we have saved earlier. 

<br />

### __14. Quit__
![Quit Game](screenshots/quit.png)
   <br/>Now came the question on how can the user quit the game? Type "quit" and the game will automatically quits the program. That's the end of the game demonstration. Now you know how to play it, dive in and have fun in it.
